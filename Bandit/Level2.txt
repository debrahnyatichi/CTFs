DISCUSSION:
Dashed filename
A "dashed filename" typically refers to a file name containing one or more hyphens or dashes (-).
Challenges with Dashed Filenames
Command Option Misinterpretation: When a filename begins with a dash, command-line utilities (like rm, mv, cp) might interpret it as a command-line option rather than a filename, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
Example: Attempting to remove a file named "-f"
rm -f: This will likely be interpreted as the "force" option for rm, not the file itself.

Strategies for Handling Dashed Filenames:
1. Prefix with ./: To explicitly tell a command that you are referring to a file in the current directory, even if its name starts with a dash, prefix the filename with ./
Example: Removing the file "-f": rm ./-f
2. Use -- (Double Dash): Many commands recognize -- as a delimiter, indicating that all subsequent arguments are filenames and not command options.
Example: Removing the file "-f": rm -- -f
3. Quoting: Enclose the entire filename in single or double quotes to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters, including leading dashes.
Example: Removing the file "-f": rm "-f"
4. Use Inode Number (Advanced): For highly problematic filenames, you can find the file's inode number using ls -i and then use find -inum <inode_number> -delete to remove it. This method bypasses filename interpretation entirely.


#SOLN: 
To open a - file use: cat ./- or cat -- -
- is normally treated as “standard input” by commands, not a filename.
Using ./- or -- - tells the command you really mean the file literally named -.
