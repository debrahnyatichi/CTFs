COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED TO SOLVE THIS LEVEL
ssh

DISCUSSION:
One of the SSH hardening practice is to change the default SSH port. It reduces the number of bot attacks on the server.
The default SSH port number is 22. So when you use ssh user@IP, it tries to connect to the default port 22. But if the remote server uses some other port for SSH, you should provide the port number:ssh -p port_number user@IP

SOLN: 
Open Linux terminal and type: ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

EXPLANATION:
ssh → means “secure shell.” It lets you connect safely to another computer over the internet.

-p 2220 → tells SSH to use port 2220 instead of the default port (22).

bandit0@ → this is the username you’ll log in with (bandit0).

bandit.labs.overthewire.org → this is the address (hostname) of the remote computer you’re connecting to.
